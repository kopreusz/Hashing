        "is a technic that let us perform many things in linear time. In case you have used nested loops, that are usally require us $O(n^2)$, a good hashtable can reduce it to $O(n)$. The key idea is the following: If we have a dictionary, a lookup only requires us $O(1)$ steps on average, so if we could transform our input into a hashtable, that are $(key,value)$ pairs in linear time, we may get a good use of that $O(1)$ complex lookup. If one who has further interest in the proof of the claim, that lookup in a dictionary requires us $O(1)$ steps on average we recomend reading \"Larry Carter and Mark Wegman Universal Classes of Hash Functions\" theorem 10 on page 151, Journal of Computer and System Science 18 (1979)\n",
